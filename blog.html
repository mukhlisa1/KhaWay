                <h2>Ms. Sofia – Turning Nervousness into Confidence</h2>
                <p>"One of my most memorable students was 10-year-old Alina. She was shy during her first class and struggled to speak even basic sentences.
                I designed games and storytelling exercises that allowed her to practice without feeling pressured. By the end of the term, Alina was confidently introducing herself and even telling short stories in English.
                Watching her grow has been one of my proudest moments as a teacher."</p>

                <h2>Mr. Jacob – Making Grammar Fun</h2>
                <p>"As a grammar enthusiast, I love showing students that learning grammar doesn’t have to be boring.
                I had a group of teenagers who dreaded grammar lessons, so I turned it into a competition with points and prizes.
                By the end, not only did they master the rules, but they also started to see grammar as a puzzle they enjoyed solving!"</p>

                <p>Aya, a 14-year-old from Japan, joined Khaway School with very basic English. Her dream was to study abroad in an English-speaking country.

                <p>Samir, an 8-year-old from Egypt, struggled to stay focused during traditional lessons.
                His teacher incorporated his love for video games into the curriculum, using interactive games and activities to teach vocabulary and sentence structure.
